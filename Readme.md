Description:
-------------------------
If you happen to own a 9mm M&P Shield and have medium to large hands, you probably can't get all your fingers on it without the extended magazine.

Unfortunately, the pistol ships with just one extended magazine and they are hard/impossible to come by in stores. Sellers who have them are generally charging $20-30 above MSRP. The extended magazines also have a poorly designed base pad that can slide up the magazine and cause it not to "lock in" when reloading.

In an effort to safely improve weapon grip while fixing the failures caused by the two-piece design on factory made 8-round magazines, I began testing these printable designs.

* USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! These parts CAN fail catastrophically. Failing to address layer and material strength drastically increases this possibility.  


Instructions:
-------------------------
* Find "Mag_extender_4_back_turned.stl" and "Mag_extender_4_front_turned.stl". This is the most successful iteration and it must be printed as 2 parts.
* Print them with only 1 or 2 perimeters and no infill. I used ABS, other flexible filaments may work well. PLA should probably be avoided because it has a tendency to shatter rather than bend.
* Reference the image "Make holes at the red areas.jpg" - You'll want to drill or cut here.
* You should now see the interior of your hollow part. If it isn't empty space in there, the next step will not go well.
* Use epoxy to fill both halves to the brim. Ensure that the epoxy is not too viscous - this will cause voids in the part that will become weak spots. For reference, "i used this epoxy.jpg" shows what was used on the test piece.
* Let the epoxy set a little bit. You want it to be tacky enough to still bond to itself, but not runny enough to readily pour out of the part.
* Looking at "Make holes at the red areas.jpg", on the surface that you cut or drilled, apply fresh epoxy to the remaining green areas
* Clamp or tape the two halves together such that the red areas are joined. You want to glue the bases of your printed halves together to form the completed part.


Testing:
-------------------------
As I mentioned, I have been trying to find a design that is an improvement over the stock parts. I want improved grip on the weapon and a one-piece design so that nothing can slide around when dropped.

Although one of the designs that was tested includes a cavity that allows a 7-round magazine to hold 8 rounds, this design did not resist damage from being dropped very well. After 3 drops on gravel, the layers started to fail.

The pieces with no cavity survived a couple of drops more than the 8-round design. Ultimately, the layers of a printed piece do not seem strong enough to survive being dripped on a hard surface.

Once filled with epoxy, the printed part had no trouble surviving 12 drops from 7 feet onto gravel (the magazine was empty and dropped with the printed piece facing closest to the ground)

Refer to "before drop test.jpg" and "after drop test.jpg" to see the resultant damage. Dents and jagged edges may make the grip uncomfortable after dropping, but layers did not fail and the magazine functioned fine while firing 21 rounds afterwards.

While it may appear that the glued surface has separated, I think this has to do with the lighting. Both halves are still quite well bonded together.
