Use of any of these parts shall constitute your acceptance of the following:

a) I (the file's author) am released from any and all liability
b) No warranties, express or implied, are provided
c) USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! These parts CAN fail catastrophically. Failing to address layer and material strength drastically increases this possibility.

If you are still reading... here is what I did to achieve descent results. DO NOT ASSUME THAT THE PRINTED PARTS ARE STRONG ENOUGH BY THEMSELVES!!!! A few drops on a hard surface is all it takes to make the layers fail.

Here is what I did to make a piece that has lasted through a dozen or so drop tests on gravel and had no problem firing 21 rounds afterwards:
a) Find "Mag_extender_4_back_turned.stl" and "Mag_extender_4_front_turned.stl".
b) These are oriented in what I consider to be the optimum printing position. Print them with only 1 or 2 perimeters and no infill. I used ABS, other flexible filaments may work well. PLA should probably be avoided because it has a tendency to shatter rather than bend.
c) Other STL and original IPT files are provided... just because. Delete them or use them as you see fit.
d) Find "Make holes at the red areas.jpg"
e) Make holes in the red areas... duh. You should now see the interior of you hollow part. If it isn't empty space in there,
the next step will not go well.
f) Use epoxy to fill both halves to the brim. Ensure that the epoxy is not too viscous - this will cause voids in the part that will become weak spots.
g) Give the epoxy some time to settle into the voids and thicken - otherwise it will just spill out in the next step. Don't let the epoxy get so hard that it won't bond to anything though.
g) Spill a bit more epoxy on what is left of the printed surface - only on the sides that were stuck to the build plate
h) Hold the two surfaces together
i) Once it hardens, you can reassemble the magazine and enjoy having an extra finger's worth of grip while using the shorter magazine.

Before and after pictures demonstrate what happened after being dropped from approximately 7 feet onto gravel 12 times (while the magazine was empty). The damage appears to be mostly superficial - dents and dings, but no layer separation. I think the lighting in the second picture makes it seem as though the joint between the two halves is failing, but really it hasn't changed.

Note that one of the versions of this "magazine extender" *Can* be used to hold an 8th round. Assembly is trickier and this version only survived 3 drops before layers started to fail. If you have the means of producing a solid piece, perhaps then it would be strong enough to survive being dropped. The walls were too thin for the epoxy-filled-cavity trick to work.
